      <p class="maintext">
        The Golden Key is an event hosted by Coney and The City of London Corporation. Coney and The City of London
        Corporation
        are the Data Controllers for The Golden Key.

      <h3> Who we are</h3>
      <p class="maintext"> Throughout this policy, ‘we’ refers to Coney and The City of London Corporation.</p>

        Toynbee Studios, 28 Commercial Street, London, UK, E1 6AB.
        The City is not a Limited Liability Company or LLP or similar, it’s a corporation by prescription, therefore we

        does own
        certain wholly owned private and charitable companies through which it discharges certain of its functions, but
        these
        are not representative of the City as a public body.

        anonymised before it is shared with any third parties and is therefore no longer personal data.

        We use online advertising to keep you aware of what we’re up to as well as upcoming events. Like many companies,
        we may target you with ads when you use other websites and apps, based on your Contact, Technical, Usage and
        Profile Data. We do this using a variety of digital marketing networks and ad exchanges, and a range of
        advertising technologies such as pixels, ad tags, and cookies, as well as specific services offered by some
        sites and social networks, such as Facebook’s Custom Audience Service.</p>
      <p class="maintext">
        We use a range of analytics and targeted advertising tools to display relevant
        advertisements on other websites and apps (as described above) to you, deliver relevant content to you in
        marketing communications (where applicable), and to measure the effectiveness of the advertising provided. For
        example, we use Google Analytics to analyse Google's interest-based advertising data and/or third-party audience
        data (such as age, marital status, life event, gender and interests) to target and improve our marketing
        campaigns, marketing
        strategies and website content. We may also use tools provided by other third parties, such as Facebook, Content
        Square, Adroll, Responsys, Criteo and Bing to perform similar tasks, using your Contact, Technical, Usage and
        Profile Data.

        For The Golden Key, we use a third-party provider, Mailchimp, to deliver our newsletters. Through this we

        event.
        We aim
        to create intimate, respectful and trusting relationships between everyone involved. We are committed to a

        In order to deliver projects and keep participants safe, we may need information like medical details,

        information, access requirements and notes and feedback on participants’ work with us. This may be passed to
        emergency
        services if necessary.

      <p class="maintext">
        For people under 16 years old, we will use a nominated adult as a first point of communication, switching to
        the
        child
        on consent from that nominated adult or where needed to fulfil a contract.
